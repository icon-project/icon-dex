    Once it accepts ownership of the token, it becomes the token's sole controller
    that can execute any of its functions.

    The smart token must be set on construction and cannot be changed afterwards.
    Wrappers are provided (as opposed to a single 'execute' function)
    for each of the token's functions, for easier access.

    Note that the controller can transfer token ownership to a new controller that
    doesn't allow executing any function on the token, for a trustless solution.
    Doing that will also remove the owner's ability to upgrade the controller.
